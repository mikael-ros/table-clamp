# Table clamp cable holder

This repository contains the assets for a very simple cable holder design I made. 

It is by no means a complex design at all, and I'm only sharing it for documentations sake, really. Feel free to use it though, just keep the license in mind.

This design was creating using FreeCAD. I am self-taught and a beginner, so there may be many flaws.

## Printing
I printed it with eSun PLA+ with the following settings on a Sovol SV06 with default firmware:

- 215 C end temperature, 60 C bed temp
- generate supports: true
- 3 mm layer height

Sliced in Cura. I recommend orienting the print such that the layers run vertically, for maximum strength.

I recommend at the very least sanding down the edges of the loop such that it does not damage or fray your cables.

## How to use
### Tools / parts needed
- Screw, nut, and washer (if necessary)
- Screwdriver

### Assembly
1. Piece the two parts together with the slot behind the hole. 
2. Guide the screw through, and place the washer on the other side. 
3. Secure with nut slightly.

### Mounting
With the nut / screw slightly loose, place clamp on desired table edge, and press together. Tighten screws. For friction fit (recommended), pull off and adjust it such that is a millimeter or so less wide.

## Applications

The main purpose of the design is to guide cables through it and push it onto a table edge, thereby clamping the cables in place whilst being flexible enough that you can pull more length out when necessary. I am using it on my bedside table to organize my charging cables, with the ability to tuck them neatly back after I wake up yet still pull them long enough to use my phone in bed.

The goal was to make the design as simple to create and print as possible, hence the slightly minimalist nature of the design.

Other usecases may include using it as some form of... spaghetti holder?

## Design limitations
The design only supports table thicknesses ranging from about 20 mm to 30 mm, but this is easily modifiable if needed.
